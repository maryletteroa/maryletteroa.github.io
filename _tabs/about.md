Hello! My name is Marylette.

In working life, I mostly deal with a bunch of numbers, metrics, and data. I started in the academe as a researcher specializing in bioinformatics and genomics. Currently, I'm a data professional with experience in data analytics and data engineering (between you and me, I like DE more ;D ). My programming language of choice is `Python` but I write a lot of `SQL` and build dashboards too.

In general life, I'm very low-key. I like to watch TV shows, read, play video games, draw, and write. I also do crafty things like needle work and DIY decor projects.

I try to live by the saying "ichi-go ichi-e" - "one time, one meeting" which means to cherish the moment as it cannot happen again. I am still learning and (forever), a work-in-progress.

This is my personal website wherein I talk about the things I learn, my thoughts, as well as showcase some of my personal projects. 

Thanks for stopping by. üçµ

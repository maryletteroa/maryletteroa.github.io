Hello! My name is Marylette.

I'm a data professional with experience in data analytics and data engineering. I started my career as a bioinformatician in the field of genomics, which combines (molecular) biology, computer science, and data science. Currently, I work as a Data Engineer and my interests lean over to the infrastructure side with occasional dips into analytics. My programming language of choice is `Python` but I write a lot of `SQL` and build dashboards too.

This is my personal website wherein I talk about the things I learn, my thoughts, as well as showcase some of my personal projects. I am still learning and (forever), a work-in-progress.

Thank you for stopping by. üçµ

Hello! My name is Marylette. I mostly deal with a bunch of numbers, and metrics, and data. In general life, I like to read, play video games, draw, and write. I am still learning and (forever), a work-in-progress.

This is my personal website wherein I talk about the things I learn, my thoughts, as well as showcase some of my personal projects. 

Thanks for stopping by. â˜•

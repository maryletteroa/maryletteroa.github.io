In keeping up with my goal to do more learning this year (as opposed to 2024 which was dedicated to exploring my first love [^1] -- arts and crafts. [^2]), I'm allotting some time outside the daily grind for learning. 

My overarching goal is to explore popular data engineering tools such as `dbt`, and cloud technologies such as Azure Fabric and Snowflake. I haven't worked in Databricks since 2021 so it'll be a good opportunity to re-learn and catch up with the new developments.

Here are some notes and impressions of how the learning is coming along so far.

[^1:] Second love is Science. And alas Data is only third :p.  
[^2:] Top of the list is still needlework (cross-stitch), then Perler beading. Crocheting was a good revisit and was suprisingly enjoyable although my wrists and fingers suffered *a whole lot* more than I cared to admit.

I'm going through the dbt course in Udemy [The Complete dbt (Data Build Tool) Bootcamp: Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-dbt-data-build-tool-bootcamp-zero-to-hero-learn-dbt/).[^3] 


[^3:]It was between this and [dbt Learn](https://www.getdbt.com/dbt-learn) platform - I might go back to that for review later. Lecturers worked in Databricks and co-founded dbt Learn so I decided to do this course first - and in the process, subtract from the ever growing number of Udemy courses that I haven't finished :p

Here's what I did today:
- Created a [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) trial account. It's good for 30 days with $400 credit.
- Setup Snowflake warehouse and permissions for `dbt`, ingested Airbnb data hosted in AWS S3 into the raw tables.
- In my local machine, installed Python 3.12.7 (I needed to downgrade from Python 3.13.0 as [it's not yet supported by dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/faqs/Core/install-python-compatibility)). I also installed `virtualenv` using Homebrew but I realized I could have just installed it using `pip`. 
- Installed `dbt-snowflake` in the virtual environment (always use a Python virtual environment!)
- Create a dbt user directory `mkdir ~/.dbt`
- Initialized dbt project (`dbt init dbtlearn`) and connected it to the Snowflake account. I also learned just to delete the project directory when deleting a project (I made a configuration mistake! :p)
- Updated  `dbt_project.yml` to remove examples; deleted examples from the project directory
- Install dbt plugin "Power User for dbt core" in VS Code and set it up.

As an aside, I got distracted because the lecturer's VS Code has Copilot enabled so I tried to setup mine. The free version is supposed to be one click and a Github authentication away but for some reason it's bugging in my IDE even though I've tried uninstalling then installing it. Leaving it alone for now.

I finished Zach's Free YouTube [Data Engineering bootcamp](DataExpert.io) which started November last year and will run until February 7 (the deadline was extended from last day of January).

The topics covered were:
- Dimensional Data Modeling  
- Fact Data Modeling  
- Apache Spark Fundamentals  
- Applying Analytical Patterns  
- Real-time pipelines with Flink and Kafka  
- Data Visualization and Impact  
- Data Pipeline Maintenance  
- KPIs and Experimentation  
- Data Quality Patterns

Zach Wilson did a good job of explaining the topics (and I must say, I'm also very impressed with how well he can explain the labs while writing the code without missing a beat). The Data Expert community was also an incredible lot, as some of the setup and homeworks were a bit complicated without prior exposure.

It was a challenging 6 weeks of my life with lectures, labs, and homeworks so much so that there was some lingering emptiness when my scheduled freed up as I finished the bootcamp. I'm glad I went through it and it's a good jumping off point for my learning goal this year.

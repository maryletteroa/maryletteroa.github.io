In keeping up with my goal to do more learning this year, I'm allotting some time outside the daily grind for learning. 

My overarching goal is to explore popular data engineering tools such as `dbt`, and cloud technologies such as Azure Fabric and Snowflake. I haven't worked in Databricks since 2021 so it'll be a good opportunity to re-learn and catch up with the new developments.

Here are some notes and impressions of how the learning is coming along so far, written in reverse chronological order.

- I've moved the dbt notes here [dbt-notes]({% link _posts/2025-02-02-dbt-notes.md %})
- There's a separate post for [ERDs and Mermaid 🧜‍♀️]({% link _posts/2025-02-09-erd-and-mermaid.md %})

## 23. 2025-02-25 (Tuesday) - Table types in Snowflake, Zero-copy cloning, Swapping

### Table types
Different table types differ in Time travel and Failsafe capabilities, and can be used to manage storage cost

| Permanent | Transient | Temporary |
| - | - | - |
| `CREATE TABLE` | `CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE` | `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` | 
| Time travel and Failsafe | Time travel up to 1 day, and no Failsafe | Time travel up to 1 day, and no Failsafe  |
| Persists after session | Persists after session | Does not persist after session |
| For important data that needs full data protection | For large data that does not need full data protection | For testing, or data that does not need to persist | 

```sql
-- test_name is either a transient or temporary table
-- This will not work
ALTER TABLE test_name 
SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS  = 2; -- only 0 or 1 will work
```

No naming conflict will occur between temporary table with the same name as permanent or transient table. In this case, usage will be as if the transient or permanent table is hidden. Creating a permanent table after transient table of the same name will supersede the transient table, creating a transient table of the same name will supersede the permanent table. Temporary table persists unless the session is closed.

Transient databases or schemas can be created, but not temporary databases or schemas

```sql
CREATE TRANSIENT DATABASE transient_db;
CREATE TRANSIENT SCHEMA transient_schema;
```

Objects in a permanent database can be permanent, transient or temporary tables. Objects in a transient database can be either transient or temporary tables not permanent.

### Zero-copy cloning
Zero-copy means data isn't really copied, just the metadata. It is a metadata operation executed by the cloud provider. No additional storage cost will be incurred unless updates such as  modifying data or adding data to the clone are carried out. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name_clone
CLONE table_name;
```

Zero-copy cloning is commonly done on databases, schemas, and tables but can also be applied to other objects (such as stream, file format, sequence, external stages, pipes for external stages, tasks, and database roles).

Clones are snapshots of the source, and are independent objects. Sources are not affected if clones are modified. Likewise, clones are not affected if sources are modified. Clones are useful for development purposes. Cloning a database or schema will recursively clone contained objects.


Other considerations:
- Cloning does not include the history of the source but it would have its own history.
- Cloning a temporary table or a transient table to a permanent table is not possible
- Cloning a permanent table to a temporary or transient table is possible
- Can clone within the same database, and between different databases.

More information in [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-clone).

A clone can be created from a time travel point. A clone can also be cloned.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE time_travel_clone
CLONE time_travel before (statement => '<query_id');
```

### Swap
Swapping is also a metadata operation, and is useful when switching development to production.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ...
SWAP WITH target_table_name

ALTER SCHEMA schema_name ...
SWAP WITH schema_table_name
```
In this case, after swapping, `table_name` would have the (meta)data of `target_table_name` and `target_table_name` would have the (meta)data of `table_name`. It is essentially a name swap.

Swapping a permanent or transient table with a temporary table is not allowed as this may result in a name conflict when the temporary table is renamed as a permanent or transient table.












## 22. 2025-02-24 (Monday) - Snowflake Time travel and fail safe

### Time travel

Time travel lets users query deleted or updated data, and restore tables, schemas, and databases. The maximum retention period for time travel depends on the Snowflake edition; however, unless set, the default is 1 day.

| Edition | Time travel period up to n days|
| - | - | 
| Standard | 1 | 
| Enterprise | 90 | 
| Virtual Private | 90 | 


There are several ways to do time travel, using
- `TIMESTAMP`
- `OFFSET` in seconds
- `QUERY_ID`

```sql
SELECT * FROM table AT (TIMESTAMP => timestamp);
SELECT * FROM table AT(OFFSET => -10*60);
SELECT * FROM table BEFORE(STATEMENT => <query_id>);
```
Tables, schemas, and databases can be undropped. `UNDROP` will fail if there is an existing table with the same name. If multiple tables of the same name are dropped, restore will take effect for the latest table only. Ownership privileges are needed to restore objects.


```sql
UNDROP TABLE table_name;
UNDROP SCHEMA schema_name;
UNDROP DATABASE database_name;
```

DO NOT replace an existing table with a query id - this will delete the historical query ids. Instead, create a backup table with the restored data, truncate and insert from backup table into the target table. Target table will retain the historical query ids.


```sql
-- Bad method

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.public.test as
SELECT * FROM OUR_FIRST_DB.public.test before (statement => '01ba9b39-030c-77e8-000b-8ec3000690ea');


SELECT * FROM OUR_FIRST_DB.public.test;

-- Good method
-- Create a back up table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.public.test_backup as
SELECT * FROM OUR_FIRST_DB.public.test before (statement => '019b9ef0-0500-8473-0043-4d830007309a');

-- Truncate and insert into target table from backup table
TRUNCATE OUR_FIRST_DB.public.test;

INSERT INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.public.test
SELECT * FROM OUR_FIRST_DB.public.test_backup;

SELECT * FROM OUR_FIRST_DB.public.test ;
```


Larger retention time results in higher cost. Retention time can be set per table. Zero (0) retention time in a table means the table can not be recovered. It will automatically go into Fail Safe mode.

```sql
-- Contains table info including retention period
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%CUSTOMERS%';

-- Update retention period
ALTER TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS
SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 2;

-- Specifiy table retention period on creation
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.public.ret_example (
    id int,
    first_name string,
    last_name string,
    email string,
    gender string,
    Job string,
    Phone string)
DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 3;

```

### Fail safe
Fail safe ensures protection of historical data in case of disaster. This is a non-configurable 7-day period that permanent tables can be restored. It starts immediately after the retention period is over, and requires reaching out to Snowflake support. This also contributes to storage cost.

Fail safe and Time travel storage can be viewed in Snowflake UI: Admin > Cost Management, choose the Snowflake account name, usage type: Storage, group by: Type

<center><img src="/assets/images/learning-log/snowflake-storage.png" alt="snowflake-storage.png" width="500"/></center>

Storage can also be queried from Snowflake database.

```sql
-- Storage usage on account level
SELECT 	USAGE_DATE, 
		STORAGE_BYTES / (1024*1024*1024) AS STORAGE_GB,  
		STAGE_BYTES / (1024*1024*1024) AS STAGE_GB,
		FAILSAFE_BYTES / (1024*1024*1024) AS FAILSAFE_GB
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.STORAGE_USAGE ORDER BY USAGE_DATE DESC;


-- Storage usage on table level
SELECT 	ID, 
		TABLE_NAME, 
		TABLE_SCHEMA,
		ACTIVE_BYTES / (1024*1024*1024) AS STORAGE_USED_GB,
		TIME_TRAVEL_BYTES / (1024*1024*1024) AS TIME_TRAVEL_STORAGE_USED_GB,
		FAILSAFE_BYTES / (1024*1024*1024) AS FAILSAFE_STORAGE_USED_GB
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS
ORDER BY FAILSAFE_STORAGE_USED_GB DESC;

```


## 21. 2025-02-21 (Friday) - Snowflake Snowpipe

Snowpipe enables automatically loading files from cloud provider bucket or container into Snowflake warehouse. It is suitable for continuous loading rather than batch loading. (For batch loading, COPY command is more suitable)

General step (AWS S3)
- In Snowflake, create stage with the storage integration object and appropriate file format object
- Create a table
- Create a pipe object, and see description `DESC`
    - Test the COPY command independently to make sure it works

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE pipe MANAGE_DB.pipes.pipe_name
    auto_ingest = TRUE
    AS
    COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.table_name
    FROM @MANAGE_DB.external_stages.csv_folder ;

    // Describe pipe
    DESC pipe pipe_name;
    ```

- In `DESC`, take note of (copy) `notification_channel` value, will setup the AWS S3 with this
- In AWS S3, configure bucket by adding event notification with appropriate role
    - Add the `notification_channel` value to SQS queue ARN
- Upload a file to the S3 bucket, and check Snowflake table to check the load

For error handling, query which files have been loaded, and the respective errors in Snowpipe or the COPY command

```sql
// see what files have been processed
ALTER PIPE pipe_name refresh;
 
// Validate pipe is actually working
SELECT SYSTEM$PIPE_STATUS('pipe_name');

// Snowpipe error message
SELECT * FROM TABLE(VALIDATE_PIPE_LOAD(
    PIPE_NAME => 'MANAGE_DB.pipes.pipe_name',
    START_TIME => DATEADD(HOUR,-2,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())));

// COPY command history from table to see error massage
SELECT * FROM TABLE (INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COPY_HISTORY(
   table_name  =>  'OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.TABLE_NAME',
   START_TIME =>DATEADD(HOUR,-2,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())));
```

In Azure, aside from the above equivalent steps to grant appropriate permission to the Snowflake app, the Queue needs to be set up as well as a notification integration object in Snowflake

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION snowpipe_event
  ENABLED = true
  TYPE = QUEUE
  NOTIFICATION_PROVIDER = AZURE_STORAGE_QUEUE
  AZURE_STORAGE_QUEUE_PRIMARY_URI = 'azure://<your-container-url>'
  AZURE_TENANT_ID = '<your-tenant-id>';
```


## 20. 2025-02-20 (Thursday) - Loading data from AWS, Azure, and GCP into Snowflake

General steps:
1. In cloud provider, create a storage account. There is file-transfer savings when selecting the same region as Snowflake.
2. Create a bucket or container
3. Upload the file
4. In Snowflake, setup the a storage integration object

    ```sql
    create or replace storage integration s3_int
    TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
    STORAGE_PROVIDER = S3
    ENABLED = TRUE 
    STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = '' -- Value from AWS Role
    STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://<your-bucket-name>/<your-path>/', 's3://<your-bucket-name>/<your-path>/')
    COMMENT = 'This an optional comment' ;
    
    DESC integration s3_int;
    ```

5. In cloud provider, set Policies / Permissions and add appropriate role of the object from Snowflake. The values for these are returned from `DESC`

To Load the file into Snowflake
1. Create a file format
2. Create a stage referencing the storage integration object 


    ```sql
    create or replace file format demo_db.public.fileformat_azure
        TYPE = CSV
        FIELD_DELIMITER = ','
        SKIP_HEADER = 1; -- try 0 first to check if there is a header or not

    create or replace stage demo_db.public.stage_azure
        STORAGE_INTEGRATION = azure_integration
        URL = '<azure://storageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net/containername>'
        FILE_FORMAT = fileformat_azure;

    LIST @demo_db.public.stage_azure;
    ```

3. Create a table
4. Load the data into the table from stage using the COPY command


It's also possible to unload data from Snowflake to the cloud provider. The default copy is compressed with automatically selected compression type but it's also possible to specify how to compress the data.


```sql
-- create storage object
-- create file format
-- create stage (e.g. @stage_gcp) referencing storage object and file format

COPY INTO @stage_gcp
FROM
TABLE;
```


## 19. 2025-02-19 (Wednesday) - Performance considerations in Snowflake, scaling up/down, scaling out, caching, and cluster keys

Many performance optimizations are managed automatically in Snowflake. However, there are still designs and best practices that users can do. These include
- Assigning appropriate data types
- Sizing virtual warehouses
- Taking advantage of caching
- Customizing cluster keys


### Dedicated virtual warehouse
Have separate virtual warehouses according to different workloads or user groups e.g. dedicated virtual warehouses for BI team, Data Science team, and Marketing department

Consider:
- Not too many warehouses such that underutilization occurs
- Refine classifications as work patterns change

### Scaling up vs Scaling Out

Scaling up | Scaling out
-| - 
Increasing the size of virtual warehouses | Using additional warehouses / multi-cluster warehouses of the same size
More complex query | More concurrent users / queries


### Caching
- If query is executed twice, results are cached and can be re-used
- Speeds up the queries
- Results are cached for 24 hours or until underlying data has changed
- Ensure that similar queries go on the same warehouse
- Running the same query on the same data on the same warehouse will be faster than running it for the first time
- Group same usage patterns together


### Cluster key

- Subset of rows to locate the data in micro-partitions
- For large tables, this improves the scan efficiency in queries
- Snowflake automatically maintains these cluster keys
- In general, Snowflake produces well-clustered tables
- Cluster keys are not always ideal and can change over time
- Manually customize these cluster keys

How to cluster
- Columns that are used most frequently in WHERE-clauses (often date columns for even tables)
- If typically use filters on two columns then the table can also benefit from two cluster keys
- Column that is frequently used in Joins
- Large enough number of distinct values to enable effective grouping
- Small enough number of distinct values to allow effective grouping

```sql
CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME ... CLUSTER BY COLUMN_1 [, COLUMN_2]; 
CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME ... CLUSTER BY EXPRESSION;
ALTER TABLE TABLE_NAME ... CLUSTER BY EXPRESSION_1, [, EXPRESSION_2];
ALTER TABLE TABLE_NAME ... DROP CLUSTERING KEY
```

Partition pruning - eliminates all other partitions to look at because there are no data of interest there based on micro-partitions from cluster keys


## 18. 2025-02-18 (Tuesday) - Loading unstructured data into Snowflake

Steps to load unstructured data (such as JSON or Parquet) into Snowflake:
- Create stage, define file format
- Load raw data (type `VARIANT` can handle all kinds of unstructured data)
- Analyse & Parse
- Flatten & Load

### Load JSON files

To load JSON file(s) into a Raw Table, create a stage, define a JSON file format, create a raw data table, then copy the raw JSON into the raw data table 

```sql
USE DB_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME;

-- Load Raw JSON

CREATE OR REPLACE stage JSONSTAGE
     url='s3://somejsonfiles';

LIST @JSONSTAGE;

CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT JSONFORMAT
    TYPE = JSON;


-- Create table containing one column with type Variant
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE JSON_RAW (
    RAW_FILE VARIANT
);
    
-- Load staged JSON file into table using COPY command
COPY INTO JSON_RAW
    FROM @JSONSTAGE
    file_format= JSONFORMAT
    files = ('data.json');
    
   
SELECT * FROM JSON_RAW;
```

Parse the raw JSON data using colon notation (`:`). Cast to type using double colons (`::`). Arrays are indexed from 0. JSON keys are case-sensitive (otherwise the result is `null` when keys are not found).

```sql
SELECT 
    RAW_FILE:id::int as id,  
    RAW_FILE:first_name::STRING as first_name,
    RAW_FILE:last_name::STRING as last_name,
    RAW_FILE:gender::STRING as gender
    -- nested data
    RAW_FILE:job.salary::INT as salary,
    RAW_FILE:job.title::STRING as title
    -- array
    RAW_FILE:prev_company[0]::STRING as prev_company
FROM JSON_RAW;
```

Use `TABLE()` function to flatten hierarchical data

```sql
select
    RAW_FILE:first_name::STRING as First_name,
    f.value:language::STRING as "Language",
    f.value:level::STRING as Level_spoken
from JSON_RAW, 
table(flatten(RAW_FILE:spoken_languages)) f;
```

To load into a table, use `CREATE TABLE AS` OR `INSERT INTO`

```sql
-- Create table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE Languages AS
select
    RAW_FILE:first_name::STRING as First_name,
    f.value:language::STRING as "Language",
    f.value:level::STRING as Level_spoken
from JSON_RAW, 
table(flatten(RAW_FILE:spoken_languages)) f;

-- Insert into. Table needs to be created before hand
INSERT INTO Languages
select
    RAW_FILE:first_name::STRING as First_name,
    f.value:language::STRING as "Language",
    f.value:level::STRING as Level_spoken
from JSON_RAW, 
table(flatten(RAW_FILE:spoken_languages)) f;

```

### Load Parquet files

Parquet files can be loaded from Stage

Create a stage and Parquet file format

```sql
-- Create file format and stage object
    
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT PARQUET_FORMAT
    TYPE = 'parquet';

CREATE OR REPLACE PARQUETSTAGE
    url = 's3://someparquetfiles'   
    FILE_FORMAT = PARQUET_FORMAT;

-- Preview the data
    
LIST @PARQUETSTAGE;   
    
SELECT * FROM @PARQUETSTAGE;
    
```

Query using colon notation

```sql
-- Query parquet from staging

SELECT * 
FROM @PARQUETSTAGE
(file_format => PARQUET_FORMAT);

SELECT 
    $1:__index_level_0__::int as index_level,
    $1:cat_id::VARCHAR(50) as category,
    DATE($1:date::int ) as Date,
    $1:"dept_id"::VARCHAR(50) as Dept_ID,
    $1:"id"::VARCHAR(50) as ID,
    $1:"item_id"::VARCHAR(50) as Item_ID,
    $1:"state_id"::VARCHAR(50) as State_ID,
    $1:"store_id"::VARCHAR(50) as Store_ID,
    $1:"value"::int as value
FROM @PARQUETSTAGE;

```
Load into a table from Stage using COPY command.

```sql
-- Create table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE PARQUET_DATA (
    ROW_NUMBER int,
    index_level int,
    cat_id VARCHAR(50),
    date date,
    dept_id VARCHAR(50),
    id VARCHAR(50),
    item_id VARCHAR(50),
    state_id VARCHAR(50),
    store_id VARCHAR(50),
    value int,
    Load_date timestamp default TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(current_timestamp));

-- Load using COPY command
COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.PARQUET_DATA
    FROM (SELECT 
            METADATA$FILE_ROW_NUMBER,
            $1:__index_level_0__::int,
            $1:cat_id::VARCHAR(50),
            DATE($1:date::int ),
            $1:"dept_id"::VARCHAR(50),
            $1:"id"::VARCHAR(50),
            $1:"item_id"::VARCHAR(50),
            $1:"state_id"::VARCHAR(50),
            $1:"store_id"::VARCHAR(50),
            $1:"value"::int,
            TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(current_timestamp)
        FROM @PARQUETSTAGE
        );
        
    
SELECT * FROM PARQUET_DATA;
```



## 17. 2025-02-17 (Monday) - Snowflake Copy options, rejected records, load history

Copy options modify the behaviour of the `COPY INTO` command

General form:
```sql
COPY INTO TABLE_NAME
FROM @STAGE_NAME
FILE = 'file_name1', ...
CopyOptions
```


`VALIDATION_MODE`
- validates the data files before loading them
```sql
VALIDATION_MODE = RETURN_n_ROWS | RETURN_ERRORS
```

`SIZE_LIMIT`
- Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of data loaded in the command 
- Combined file sizes of all files
- Will load first file regardless; the next file will be loaded until limit is reached (can exceed limit on last file); next file after the limit will not be loaded

```sql
SIZE_LIMIT = num
```

`RETURN_FAILED_ONLY`
- Specifies whether to return only files that have failed to load in the statement result

```sql
RETURN_FAILED_ONLY = TRUE | FALSE
```

`TRUNCATECOLUMNS`
- Specifies whether to truncate text strings that exceed the target column length
- `TRUE` - strings are automatically truncated to the target column length
- `FALSE` - COPY produces an error if a loaded string exceeds the target column length

```SQL
TRUNCATECOLUMNS = TRUE | FALSE
```

`FORCE`
- Specifies to load all files, regardless of whether they've been loaded previously and have not changed since they were loaded
- Note that this option reloads files, potentially duplicating data in a table

```SQL
FORCE = TRUE | FALSE
```

Rejected records can be queried, further processed, and saved to a table


```sql

---- 1) With VALIDATION_MODE ---- 

COPY INTO COPY_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS
    FROM @aws_stage_copy
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1)
    pattern='.*Order.*'
    VALIDATION_MODE = RETURN_ERRORS;

-- Storing rejected /failed results in a table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE rejected AS 
select rejected_record from table(result_scan(last_query_id()));

select rejected_record from table(result_scan('01ba740e-030c-57ce-000b-8ec3000360e2')); 

SELECT * FROM REJECTED;

---- 2) Without VALIDATION_MODE ---- 

COPY INTO COPY_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS
    FROM @aws_stage_copy
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1)
    pattern='.*Order.*'
    ON_ERROR=CONTINUE;
  
  
select * from table(validate(orders, job_id => '_last'));


--- can be processed further

SELECT REJECTED_RECORD FROM rejected;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE rejected_values as
SELECT 
SPLIT_PART(rejected_record,',',1) as ORDER_ID, 
SPLIT_PART(rejected_record,',',2) as AMOUNT, 
SPLIT_PART(rejected_record,',',3) as PROFIT, 
SPLIT_PART(rejected_record,',',4) as QUATNTITY, 
SPLIT_PART(rejected_record,',',5) as CATEGORY, 
SPLIT_PART(rejected_record,',',6) as SUBCATEGORY
FROM rejected; 


```


Load history can be queried from database view or from `snowflake` database

```sql
-- Query load history within a database --
USE COPY_DB;

SELECT * FROM information_schema.load_history;


-- Query load history gloabally from SNOWFLAKE database --
SELECT * FROM snowflake.account_usage.load_history;

```



## 16. 2025-02-13 (Thursday) - Snowflake COPY command, transformation, file format object

There are two main methods of loading data into Snowflake:
- Bulk - most frequent method; uses warehouse, COPY command
- Continuous - for small volumes of data; automatic once data is added to stage; Snowpipe (serverless feature)

Stages are objects in Snowflake that pertain to the location of data files. Not to be confused with staging tables in data warehouses.

There are two types of Stages
- External - from cloud provider
- Internal - from Snowflake-managed location


Example of Stage
```sql
-- Create external stage
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage
    url='s3://somefilefolder'
    credentials=(aws_key_id='ABCD_DUMMY_ID' aws_secret_key='1234abcd_key');

-- Describe properties
DESC STAGE MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage; 

-- List files in stage
LIST @aws_stage
```

Example of COPY command
```sql
COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS
    FROM @MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1)
    pattern='.*Order.*';

-- Error handling using the ON_ERROR
COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS_EX
    FROM @MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage_errorex
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1)
    files = ('OrderDetails_error.csv','OrderDetails_error2.csv')
    ON_ERROR = 'SKIP_FILE';

-- ON_ERROR = { CONTINUE | SKIP_FILE | SKIP_FILE_<num> | 'SKIP_FILE_<num>%' | ABORT_STATEMENT }
```

Example of Transformation
```sql
COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS_EX
    FROM (select 
            s.$1,
            s.$2, 
            s.$3,
            CASE WHEN CAST(s.$3 as int) < 0 THEN 'not profitable' ELSE 'profitable' END 
          from @MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage s)
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1)
    files=('OrderDetails.csv');
```


Example of file format
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE file format my_file_format
    TYPE=CSV
    FIELD_DELIMITER = '|'
    SKIP_HEADER = 1;

--Describe file format
DESC FILE FORMAT my_file_format;

--Using file format object in Copy command       
COPY INTO CUSTOMERS
    FROM @aws_stage
    file_format= (FORMAT_NAME= EXERCISE_DB.PUBLIC.my_file_format);

```



## 15. 2025-02-12 (Wednesday) - Snowflake editions, pricing and cost monitoring, roles

The different [Snowflake editions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions) are:
- Standard
- Enterprise
- Business-Critical
- Virtual Private

which have increasing data security, time travel days, failover support, but also cost. Virtual Private is an edition that needs to be coordinated directly with Snowflake. 

For [Pricing](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/pricing-options/), it can be broken down into Compute, Storage, and Data transfer costs. There is also a Cloud Service cost for behind the scene cloud tasks. This is usually minimal and only charged if the Cloud service exceeds 10% of the warehouse consumption. Data transfer is charged at egress, ingress is free (which is usually the case for cloud providers).

The Snowflake UI has a Cost Management page accessible to the ACCOUNTADMIN. In it, there is a Resource Monitor feature wherein a quota per cycle (e.g. 10 credits per month) can be set. Actions can be taken depending on the percentage of quota consumed which can exceed 100%. Actions include: 1) notify, 2) suspend and notify (which waits for queries to finish before suspending), and 3) suspend immediately and notify. 

Lastly, the different [Roles](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview) were discussed and their respective resposiblities
- ORGADMIN - manages multiple accounts
- ACCOUNTADMIN - manages all objects in the account
- SECURITYADMIN - manages grant privileges
- SYSADMIN - creates warehouses, databases, and other objects, and grants privileges on them
- USERADMIN - user and role management
- PUBLIC - automatically granted to new users by default
- Custom - assigned under SYSADMIN so the latter can manage the objects created by Custom


## 14. 2025-02-11 (Tuesday) - Snowflake setup, architecture overview, loading data

Taking a step towards my goals this year, I've started doing a deep-dive into Snowflake through learning about it in this course [Snowflake Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/snowflake-masterclass/).

Today, I've setup a Business critical Snowflake account with AWS, had a tour of the interface, and created a virtual warehouse, database, and schema using both the UI and SQL. I've also created a table, and loaded data from S3 bucket. 

There were two assignments:
- For the first one, I've created a virtual warehouse using SQL with a custom auto suspend time specified
- For the second one, I've created a new database and table, and loaded a customers CSV file from S3 bucket into that table.

My main learnings for today are:
- Snowflake consists of **3 layers**: Storage, Query Processing, and Cloud Services
- **Warehouse sizes** are from XS to 6XL, each consisting of increasing number of servers, and costing increasing number of credits per hour; increase the size based on the amount of compute required e.g. for complex computations
- **Multi-clustering** consists of more than one size in a cluster (e.g. S-S-S); increase cluster size based on the workload e.g. increased number of queries or users
- Cost is base on **credits** spent. Each credit cost in money depends on the cloud provider and region. Credits get spent on the uptime and number of servers.


## 13. 2025-02-10 (Monday) - streamlit

I've checked out [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), a Python library for creating  web apps. Unlike other libraries or frameworks like Django or even Flask, Streamlit is able to spin up a web app fast using simple syntax. It is specially useful for data science and machine learning projects. 

It is designed for quickly creating a data-driven web application. I'm not clear if it's "production-quality" and opinions seem to be divided and depend on requirements or use-case.

e.g.

```python
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

st.title('A Sample Streamlit App')

st.markdown('## This is a line chart')

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
     np.random.randn(20, 3),
     columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])

st.line_chart(chart_data)

st.markdown('## This is a table')

st.dataframe(chart_data)

```

## 12. 2025-02-09 (Sunday) - ERD, Mermaid

Today, I reviewed [ERDs and revisited Mermaid 🧜‍♀️]({% link _posts/2025-02-09-erd-and-mermaid.md %})


## 11. 2025-02-06 (Thursday) - docker, dbt-duckdb, Duckdb resources

### docker

I wanted to check Docker 🐳 and see if I can try and create a container for a data pipeline. Well, that is the goal but since I don't use Docker these days, I needed to reacquaint myself with it first.

These are some of the intro I found
- <i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> [The intro to Docker I wish I had when I started ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud7Npgi6x8E&t=563s)
- <i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> [ Learn Docker in 7 Easy Steps - Full Beginner's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAkwW2tuIqE)
- <i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> [Containerize Python Applications with Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TFWtfFY87U&t=559s)

an example of `Dockerfile`
```bash
FROM python:3.9
ADD main.py .
RUN pip install scikit-learn
CMD ["python", "./main.py"]
```

`.dockerignore` specifies the files or paths that are excluded when copying to the container

Ideally, there is only one process per container

`docker-compose.yml` - for running multiple containers at the same time

```bash
version: '3'
services:
    web:
        build: .
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
    db:
        image: "mysql"
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
        volumes:
            - db-data:/foo

volumes:
    db-data:
```
`docker-compose up` to run all the containers together  
`docker-compose down` to shutdown all containers

Will revisit this topic in the succeeding days. 

### dbt-duckdb

Here is the repo for the adapter: [dbt-duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/dbt-duckdb)

Installation should be
- `pip3 install dbt-duckdb`

### Duckdb resources

Putting these resouces here:
- [Duckdb tutorial for beginners](https://motherduck.com/blog/duckdb-tutorial-for-beginners/)
- <i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> YT Channel [@motherduckdb](https://www.youtube.com/@motherduckdb)

I just realized that this feature solves some of my challenging tasks: Since Duckdb is able to read a CSV and execute SQL query on it, there's no need to open a raw CSV just to check the sum of columns for example. The computation is in-memory too by default so no need to persist a database for quick analysis. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('path/to/your/file.csv');
```

or just using the terminal
```bash
$ duckdb -c "SELECT * FROM read_parquet('path/to/your/file.parquet');"
```


## 10. 2025-02-05 (Wednesday) - dbt-Fabric, Fireducks

### dbt-Fabric
I was looking around for how to integrate dbt to Azure, and I found these resouces
- [Setup dbt for Fabric Data Warehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-setup-dbt)
    - <i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> [How to run dbt in Microsoft Fabric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmh3Z8nhoDw&t=639s)
- Also [dbt cloud is available for Azure Fabric](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-cloud-is-now-available-for-microsoft-fabric)
    - <i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> [Configure and Create DBT Model for Fabric Warehouse using dbt Cloud ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UX5qy45c4g)


The process looks straight-forward
- Install the adapter in the virtual environment with Python 3.7 and up `pip install dbt-fabric`
- Make sure to have the [Microsoft ODBC Driver for Sql Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16#download-for-windows) installed
- Add an existing Fabric warehouse
- The dbt profile in the home directory needs to be setup
- Connect to the Azure warehouse, do the authentication
- Check the connections
- Then the dbt project can be built

Aside from Fabric, dbt also has integrations with other Azure data platforms:
- [Synapse](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/azuresynapse-setup)
- [Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/apache-airflow-jobs-dbt-fabric)
- [SQL Server](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/mssql-setup) (SQL Server 2017, SQL Server 2019, SQL Server 2022 and Azure SQL Database)

Here is the docs for other dbt core platform connections
- [dbt Core data platform connections ](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/about-core-connections)

### Fireducks
There's another duck in the data space: [Fireducks](https://fireducks-dev.github.io/)
. It's not related to DuckDB, instead it allows existing code using `pandas` to be more performant; it's fully compatible with Pandas API. 

This means there's [zero learning cost](https://medium.com/@fireducks/introduction-to-fireducks-get-performance-beyond-pandas-with-zero-learning-cost-8694d4eab9c6) as all that's needed is to replace `pandas` with `fireducks` and the code should be good to go

```python
# import pandas as pd
import fireducks.pandas as pd
```

or via terminal (no need to change the import)

```bash
python3 -m fireducks.pandas main.py
```

Whereas for `polars`, the code would need to be rewritten; polars code is closer to PySpark.

e.g.
```python
import pandas as pd
import polars as pl
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# load the file ...
#
# Filter rows where 'column1' is greater than 10
# pandas
filtered_df = df[df['column1'] > 10]
# polars
filtered_df = df.filter(pl.col('column1') > 10
# PySpark
filtered_df = df.filter(col('column1') > 10)
```

Here's a comparison of the performance: [Pandas vs. FireDucks Performance Comparison](https://blog.dailydoseofds.com/p/pandas-vs-fireducks-performance-comparison). It surpassed both `polars` and `pandas` 

## 9: 2025-02-04 (Tuesday) - Snowflake, Duckdb, Isaac Asimov Books

I'm taking a break from learning dbt, and switched focus to learning about databases: Snowflake, and Duckdb. Also, I took a bit of a break so that I can catch up on reading Isaac Asimov's series.

### Snowflake virtual warehouse

I found this free introducton in Udemy [Snowflake Datawarehouse & Cloud Analytics - Introduction](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-snowflake-cloud-data-warehouse-analytics/). This may not be the best resource out there though as it hasn't been updated. 
However, I learned about provisioning a virtual warehouse in Snowflake with the following example commands


Virtual warehouse
- collection of compute resources (CPUs and allocated memory)
- needed to query data from snowflake, and load data into snowflake
- autoscaling is available in enterprise version but not in standard version

Create a virtual warehouse
```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE TRAINING_WH
WITH
	WAREHOUSE_SIZE = XSMALL --size
	AUTO_SUSPEND = 60 -- if idle for 60s will be suspended automatically
	AUTO_RESUME = TRUE -- if use executes a query, it will automatically resume on it's own without having to manually restarted the warehouse
	INITIALLY_SUSPEND = TRUE
	STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS = 300
	STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS = 600;
```

Alternatively, use the user interface as well

Create database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE SALES_DB
DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 0
COMMENT = 'Ecommerce sales info';
```

Create schema
```sql
create schema Sales_Data;
create schema Sales_Views;
create schema Sales_Stage;
```

Use the warehouse
```sql
USE WAREHOUSE_TRAINING_WH;
USE DATABASE SALES_DB;
USE SCHEMA Sales_Data;
```

Command to find the current environment
```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA(), CURRENT_WAREHOUSE();
```

Here's a [demo of Snowflake features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PBvVeCQi0w). I learned that Snowflake has it's own data marketplace, and also has a dashboard feature.

Here are others resources for Snowflake
-  YT channel [@snowflakedevelopers](https://www.youtube.com/@snowflakedevelopers) 
- [Developers website](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/)
- [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/index)
- [Snowflake community](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)

### Duckdb overview

Another database that I've been hearing about is [Duckdb](https://duckdb.org/), and I'm honestly very interested in this one as it is light-weight and open-source. It can run in a laptop, and can process GBs of data fast.

It's a file-based database which reminds me of SQLite except that DuckDB is mostly for analytical purposes (OLAP) rather than transactional (OLTP). It utilizes vectorized execution as opposed to tuple-at a time (row-based database), or column-at-a-time execution (column-based database). It sits somewhere between row-based and column-based in that the data is processed by columns but operates on batches of data at a time. Because of this, it is more memory efficient than column execution (e.g. pandas).


Here is [Gabor Szarnyas' presentation about Duckdb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rdwh0rNaf0) which talks in detail about Duckdb capabilities. 


Duckdb isn't a one-to-one comparison with Snowflake, though as it can only scale by memory, and is not distributed (nor with Apache Spark for that matter). It also runs locally. A counterpart to this is [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/), which is a cloud data warehousing solution built on top of Duckdb (kind of like [dbt Cloud](https://www.getdbt.com/product/dbt-cloud) to dbt core).

As a side note, I was delighted to learn that DuckDB has a SQL command to exclude columns! (Lol I know but you have no idea how cumbersome it is to write all 20+ columns only to exclude a few :p)

example from [Duckdb Snippets](https://duckdbsnippets.com/snippets/2/using-the-exclude-function-in-duckdb)
```sql
// This will select all information about ducks
// except their height and weight
SELECT * EXCLUDE (height, weight) FROM ducks;
```
Whereas the top [Stack Overflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/729197/exclude-a-column-using-select-except-columna-from-tablea) for this is 
```sql
/* Get the data into a temp table */
SELECT * INTO #TempTable
FROM YourTable
/* Drop the columns that are not needed */
ALTER TABLE #TempTable
DROP COLUMN ColumnToDrop
/* Get results and drop temp table */
SELECT * FROM #TempTable
DROP TABLE #TempTable
```

I know explicitly writing column names is for "contracts" and exclude isn't very production quality but it would be immensely useful in CTEs where the source columns have already been defined previously.

Okay end of side note :p 

Do you think it's normal to fan over a database? No pun intended. : ))

### Three Laws of Robotics

I'm currently reading Isaac Asimov books. I'm on Book 2 (Foundation and Empire) of the [Foundation Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(book_series)). I kind of wanted to read the books before I watch Apple TV's Foundation but I realized the series is *totally different* from the books. It was like preparing for an exam only to get entirely out-of-scope questions (which has happened too many times before :p)

Spoiler: <details>Book 1 is logical and clever strategies towards starting a foundation planet, whereas the Apple series is all *pew*, *pew*, guns etc. Not Book 2 though, it's all *pew*, *pew*, space battle :p </details>

Anyway, the [Three Laws of Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics) (aka Asimov's Laws) didn't originate in the Foundation Books (*I just really want to talk about it* :p ) but in one of his short stories in the [I, Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot) collection. 
    
Spoiler: <details>But isn't Demerzel from Apple TV's series inspired by this? Was it a cross-over? But didn't the Robot series and the Foundation Series had cross-overs also?.</details>

The Three Laws of Robotics state:
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

The Three Laws of Robotics originally came from a science-fiction story in the 1940's but it's amazing how forward-looking it is. I'm not really into science-fiction books (I'd rather not mix the two :p) but I'm pulled into Asimov's world nonetheless.



## 8: 2025-02-02 (Sun) - dbt

### dbt - certifications and finished the course
I've finished the course today 🎉. 

I've also moved the dbt notes into [another post]({% link _posts/2025-02-02-dbt-notes.md %}) to keep the log tidier.

The last section is an interview about the official dbt certifications. I'm still not sure about doing the certification at this point (I kind of want to get more hands-on time with the tool first) but I like what the interviewee said about doing certifications - you learn a lot more about the tool, faster compared to just using it everyday. For me, I do get a lot of gains studying for certs. If I didn't have those stock knowledge in the first place, it would have been a lot harder to think of other, better ways of approaching a problem. Mostly my qualms about doing certs is how expensive they are! :p


## 7: 2025-02-01 (Sat) - dbt

### dbt - Advance Power user dbt core, introducing dbt to the company

Today isn't as technical as the last couple of days.  I've covered more features of the Power User for dbt core extension powered with AI, and tips on introducing dbt to the company.

The course is wrapping up as well, and I only have one full section left about certifications. 

I learned about 
- Advance Power User dbt core
- Introducing dbt to the company

## 6: 2025-01-31 (Fri) - dbt

### dbt - variables, and dagster

Today I've covered dbt variables and orchestration with dagster. It was my first time setting up dagster. I actually liked dagster because the integration with dbt is tight. I was a bit overwhelmed though with all the coding at the backend to setup the orchestration. It might get easier if I take a deeper look at it. For now, it seems like a good tool to use with dbt. 

## 5: 2025-01-30 (Thu) - dbt

### dbt - great expectations, debugging, and logging

I've covered these topics today: `dbt-great-expectations`, debugging, and logging. 

The dbt-great-expectations package, though not really a port of the Python package, contains many tests that are useful for checking the model. I'm glad `ge` was adapted into dbt as it's also one of the popular data testing tool in Python.

## 4: 2025-01-29 (Wed)  - dbt

### dbt - snapshots, tests, macros, packages, docs, analyses, hooks, exposures.

Today was pretty full. I've covered dbt snapshots, tests, macros, third-party packages, documentation, analyses, hooks, and exposures. Not sure how I completed all of these today but these are pretty important components of dbt. I'm amazed about the documentation support in this tool, and snapshot is another feature in which I say "where has this been all my life?" To think that SCD is that straight-forward in dbt.

## 3: 2025-01-26 (Sun) - dbt

### dbt - seeds, and source

Today, I've covered dbt seeds, and source. At first I thought - why did they need to relabel these CSV files and raw tables? The terminologies were a bit confusing but I guess I should just get used to these.

## 2: 2025-01-25 (Sat) - dbt, books, Python package, Copilot

### dbt - models, and materialization

I've covered dbt models, and materialization. These are pretty core topics in dbt - because dbt is all about models! 

### Books for LLM, and Polars

Here are some materials I came upon today

LLM Engineer's Handbook [[Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/LLM-Engineers-Handbook-engineering-production/dp/1836200072/) [[Github]](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook)
- a resource when I get around to exploring LLMs 

Polars Cookbook [[Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Polars-Cookbook-practical-transform-manipulate/dp/1805121154/)
- [Polars](https://pola.rs/) is a fast alternative to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) specially for large datasets

### pandera

> `pandera` is a Union.ai open source project that provides a flexible and expressive API for performing data validation on dataframe-like objects to make data processing pipelines more readable and robust. Dataframes contain information that pandera explicitly validates at runtime. - [[Docs]](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Here's an example from the docs. It's interesting because it seems like a lighter version of Great Expectations wherein the data can be further validated using ranges and other conditions. It's powerful for dataframe validations.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandera as pa

# data to validate
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "column1": [1, 4, 0, 10, 9],
    "column2": [-1.3, -1.4, -2.9, -10.1, -20.4],
    "column3": ["value_1", "value_2", "value_3", "value_2", "value_1"],
})

# define schema
schema = pa.DataFrameSchema({
    "column1": pa.Column(int, checks=pa.Check.le(10)),
    "column2": pa.Column(float, checks=pa.Check.lt(-1.2)),
    "column3": pa.Column(str, checks=[
        pa.Check.str_startswith("value_"),
        # define custom checks as functions that take a series as input and
        # outputs a boolean or boolean Series
        pa.Check(lambda s: s.str.split("_", expand=True).shape[1] == 2)
    ]),
})

validated_df = schema(df)
print(validated_df)
```

In [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), something like this can also be used

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, conint, confloat

class Product(BaseModel):
    quantity: conint(ge=1, le=100)  # Validates that quantity is between 1 and 100
    price: confloat(gt=0, le=1000)   # Validates that price is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000

product = Product(quantity=10, price=500)
print(product)

```

### Copilot installation, an update

The VS Code plugin that I was trying to install yesterday is working now and I am able to access chat on the side panel as well as see the prompts on screen. Not really sure what fixed it but it could be the reboot of my computer.

## 1: 2025-01-24 (Fri) - dbt, Copilot

### dbt - introduction ,and setting up

I'm going through the dbt course in Udemy [The Complete dbt (Data Build Tool) Bootcamp: Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-dbt-data-build-tool-bootcamp-zero-to-hero-learn-dbt/). I've setup a dbt project and created a Snowflake account.

It was between this and [dbt Learn](https://www.getdbt.com/dbt-learn) platform - I might go back to that for review later. Lecturers worked in Databricks and co-founded dbt Learn so I decided to do this course first - and in the process, subtract from the ever growing number of Udemy courses that I haven't finished :p  

### Github Copilot

As an aside, I got distracted because the lecturer's VS Code has Copilot enabled so I tried to setup mine. The free version is supposed to be one click and a Github authentication away but for some reason it's buggy in my IDE. Leaving it alone for now. 

## 0: 2024-11-16 (Sat) to 2025-01-08 (Wed) - DataExpert Data Engineering Bootcamp
### DE Bootcamp
I finished Zach's Free YouTube Data Engineering bootcamp ([DataExport.io](https://www.dataexpert.io)) which started November last year and will run until February 7 (the deadline was extended from last day of January).

The topics covered were:
- Dimensional Data Modeling  
- Fact Data Modeling  
- Apache Spark Fundamentals  
- Applying Analytical Patterns  
- Real-time pipelines with Flink and Kafka  
- Data Visualization and Impact  
- Data Pipeline Maintenance  
- KPIs and Experimentation  
- Data Quality Patterns

Zach Wilson did a good job of explaining the topics (I'm also very impressed with how well he can explain the labs while writing code without missing a beat). The Data Expert community was also an incredible lot, as some of the setup and homeworks were complicated without prior exposure.

It was a challenging 6 weeks of my life with lectures, labs, and homeworks so much so that there was some lingering emptiness when my schedule freed up as I finished the bootcamp. I'm glad I went through it and it's a good jumping off point for my learning goal this year.

Sharing the link to [my certification](https://bootcamp.techcreator.io/certification/maryletteroa78207/free-bootcamp-completion).

Here is a non-exhaustive, most-likely-to-evolve list of my favorite books and materials. I often find my self going through these resources as a way to learn or refresh my memory, so it is a small list at best. However, I'd most likely be going over this list again in the future if I find other useful materials.

- [Python Tricks](https://realpython.com/products/python-tricks-book/) - This book is for anyone wanting to "level-up" their Python skills and learn new ways to implement or think about certain topics in the Python programming language
- [Numsense!](https://leanpub.com/numsense) - This book's tag-line is "No Math Added". It explains machine learning concepts in layman's terms. In addition, the authors also have a blog called [Algobeans](https://http://algobeans.com/)
- [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/) - It covers the toolkit for machine learning in Python such as numpy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. It explains concepts in simple terms and is best for anyone starting out with machine learning. You need to know Python beforehand.
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - Since I don't use R a lot but is trying to learn, I find the approach of this resource effective since it gives applications of R first (such as visualization) before going into an introduction of the language.
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) - This is a book for people with good foundations for mathematics and statistics. However, it does explain the machine learning / statistical learning techniques in detail (i.e. going into the mathematical formula) so it is a good reference book for appreciating the nuances of these approaches.
- Irizarry, R. A., Love, M. I. (2015). *Data Analysis for the Life Sciences*. [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences) - It's a good resource to learn about statistics in R. The approach is code + statistics and math, though less heavy in math than concepts in stats. I like it because the explanations are clear and concise with generous examples in R. It's also a good fit for anyone wanting to apply computations in the life sciences as it includes the popular R packages used in this domain. *[Updated 2019-09-02]*

And these resources because they're entertaining practice challenges:
- [The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) - This is one of the first sites I used when I started learning Python. It is filled with puzzles that you can solve by writing scripts. It's my favorite learning game since one does a little bit of sleuthing to understand the problem. Alternatively, one site I just explored recently is [Checkio](https://py.checkio.org/). It also presents Python problems in a form of a game. In addition, you can check other player's code, so you learn other methods to solve the game as well.
- [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) - This is a resource for applying Python coding in bioinformatics. 


#### Some notes:
There is an interesting piece about MOOCs and videos by Prof. Lorena A. Barbara which can be read [here](https://www.classcentral.com/report/why-my-mooc-is-not-built-on-video/). 

Arguably, my [learning style](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-styles.shtml) is a little less auditory than it is tactile (I learn better by doing). So I guess knowing about one's learning style helps with choosing the kinds of materials for learning as well.

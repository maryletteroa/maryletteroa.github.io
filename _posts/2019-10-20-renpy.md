For October, the Python and Game Development study groups of [Women Who Code Manila](https://www.womenwhocode.com/manila) collaborated on learning how to make games using Python.

Porch, Alysson, and I led the discussion on making visual novels using Ren'Py. 

The code repo of the game is here ðŸ‘‰: [RenP'y Tutorial](https://github.com/maryletteroa/renpy-tutorial).

The link to the study guide and the sample game is [here](https://github.com/maryletteroa/renpy-tutorial). These can also be found in the [official page of WWCode Manila Python Study Group](https://wwcodemanila.github.io/WWCodeManila-Python/#), scroll down to the [Ren'Py section](https://wwcodemanila.github.io/WWCodeManila-Python/#/ren'py/introduction). 

For the Python study group the same day (back-to-back! ), we learned how to make a web application using Django. This session was lead by Anj, our newest Python mentor. 

We also had a guest speaker from Facebook Singapore, Niel, who talked about Python type annotations. Will definitely use type annotations in the future. ~ We tried to help a participant troubleshoot a snake game in Python (Alysson mostly did the hardwork), and I thought how easier it would have been if we knew the types of the inputs and outputs from reading the functions' codes. 

Thanks to everyone who attended that day's Python and Python x Game Development study groups! It was fun learning new things.

Hurray! 🏆🎉

I modified this theme from from [this layout](https://lagom.mdswanson.com/) to having two sections in the index page for Blogs (all posts), and Projects. I also added pagination using [`jekyll-paginate`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/), and modified the `index.html` to filter for each category.

And, ah, puting this up in Github page. 

A programming win to celebrate today! 😉

A couple of months ago, I applied to Microsoft's [Power Up](https://powerup.microsoft.com/) training. Luckily, I was picked as one of the participants in the March 2024 cohort.

Power Up is approximately a month-long training on the [Microsoft Power Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/). The course consisted of on-demand lectures, live Q&A sessions, and hands-on exercises.

For the final project, we were tasked with creating a full solution for an Animal Shelter. The solution would allow the users to view details of the rescues, track their status, inform foster parents, and have a report to gain insight on the going-ons in the shelter.

For the tech stack, the solution consisted of

- tables and models in [Dataverse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/dataverse)
- applications in [Power Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-apps) using two design modes: Model-driven App and Canvas App
- automatic email notifications using [Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-automate)
- and lastly, a report of summaries and news using [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi).

I think this training is a good way to learn as it included excellent lectures as well as a virtual environment for the Power Platform. It was a good opportunity and I'm thankful to have passed and graduated the program!

Here is a video of my project. The sound is a bit low, so watching is better with speakers or earphones.

Something that I came across today that I don't use often are **ternary operators** in Python. These are just conditional statements that are written succintly in a line:

```
[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false] 
```

Using the following code as an example: 

```python
weather = input("What's the weather? ")

if weather == "sunny":
    activity = "have a picnic"
elif weather == "rainy":
    activity = "watch a movie"
else:
    activity = "do anything"

print(f"Let's {activity} since the weather is {weather}.")
```

<!--more-->

Running the code will look something like this:
```
What's the weather? sunny
Let's have a picnic since the weather is sunny.

What's the weather? rainy
Let's watch a movie since the weather is rainy.

What's the weather? blah
Let's do anything since the weather is blah.
```

The if-else statement above can be written in a line so the code can also be:

```python
weather = input("What's the weather? ")

activity = "have a picnic" if weather == "sunny" else \
                "watch a movie" if weather == "rainy" else \
                "do anything"

print(f"Let's {activity} since the weather is {weather}.")
```

The use-case can be read like an English sentence:

"Let's have a picnic if the weather is sunny. Else, let's watch a movie if the weather is rainy. If it's neither of those, let's do anything!"

There are [many interesting ways](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-ternary-operator) by which ternary operators can be written - using tuples, dictionaries and lambdas (although when to use lambdas for this is beyond me rn). The conditionals are in square brackets `[ ]`, `0` evaluates to `False` and any other number to `True`.

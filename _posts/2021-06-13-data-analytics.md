Here is a repository containing template projects and exercises involving data analytics üëâ [Data Analytics](https://github.com/maryletteroa/data_analytics)


An ML pipeline can look something like this:

- Data acquisition and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
	- Summary statistics
	- Visualization
	- Preliminary statistics
- Feature engineering
	- Feature reduction
	- Scaling
- Spot checking algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model training and evaluation
- Model selection
- Explaning the model

Cloud technologies also makes it possible to develop and deploy data products, which involve the following tasks on top of those mentioned above:

- Model deployment
- Batch prediction


Still fairly new to cloud technologies (I used Google Map API, and DialogFlow before) and so currently looking into Google Cloud Products ‚òÅÔ∏è.
